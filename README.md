# TCP Scanner

A simple TCP scanner written in Go. 

A lot of times I just want a simple scan to check which of the 65535 ports are open. I know Nmap can do this, however it tends to be slow.

## TODO

- Allow user to provide url
- Allow user to provide number of workers/threads (Default workers is 100)
- Allow user to provide specific ports to scan
